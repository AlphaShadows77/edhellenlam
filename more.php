				Sindarin is a language which was created by J.R.R. Tolkien starting in 1917. Back then the name of the language Tolkien worked on was “Goldorin” alors called “Gnomic”. It was renamed “Noldorin” in the twenties and then Sindarin during the fifties. The linguist was working simultaneously on Qenya, which he started in 1915, a language which is to Sindarin what Latin is to French. This one was later renamed “Quenya”.<br>
				Sindarin is one of the elvish languages Tolkien created we can find in his books. When the elvish population divided so did the languages. The Sindars, the grey elves, are the one who spoke Sindarin. After the One Ring was destroyed, it became the language to speak for the elves.<br>
				<br>
				We don’t have that much informations about how Sindarin works, especially if we compare it to our knowledges about quenya. Anyway, we will give you here a resume of what we found. However please remember that the main purpose of this website is to be a dictionary which is easy to use. There is also a chance that you may not find a word. Of course this dictionary is in no way complete and the lack of knowledge about sindarin that even experts have is not helping. As David Salo, a famous specialist of Tolkien’s language, said in a written exchange with a french linguist who has for a nickname Linguisticae in Internet, “at least in published works, the available vocabulary for sindarin is quite small and much smaller than for quenya. [He] ha[s] not done a recent count but [he] think[s] it’s still 2000 words of fewer.” We could also add that the universe created by Tolkien being fictive, there are many words we use in our daily lives that simply don’t exist in Sindarin. Besides despite many years of work on Sindarin, Tolkien has not done a complete grammar for his language.<br>
				<br>
				Neosindarin is a type of Sindarin reconstructed thanks to what Tolkien left but not directly described by him. Neosindarin exists in two shapes :
			</p>

			<ul>

				<li>
					The first one’s purpose is to be used in our daily life, which means in our world. 
				</li>

				<li>
					The second one is used in Tolkien’s universe, for example in the movies or Role Playing Games.
				</li>

			</ul>

			<p>
				David Salo is the one who was in charge of the creation of the Neosindarin we can hear in the movies. He used what already existed to fill the holes Tolkien left. Salo almost never created any root for his work.

			<h1 class="u"> Pronunciation </h1>

			<p>
				The <strong>emphatic syllable</strong> in Sindarin...:
			</p>

			<ul>

				<li>
					...is the <strong>second to last</strong> in word with 2 syllables.<br>
					<span class="tab u">Example</span> : <strong>edh</strong>-el
				</li>

				<li>
					...is the <strong>third to last</strong> in words with 2 syllables <em>when there is a vowel in the second to last which is only followed by one consonant.</em><br>
					<span class="tab u">Example</span> : <strong>va</strong>-li-nor
				</li>

				<li>
					...is the <strong>second to last</strong> in words with 2 syllables <em>when this very syllable contains a vowel which is followed by at least two consonant.</em><br>
					<span class="tab u">Example</span> : sui-<strong>lan</strong>-non
				</li>

			</ul>

			<h1 class="u"> Determiners </h1>

			<ul>

				<li> 
					There is no indefinite article in Sindarin.<br>
					<span class="tab u">Example :</span> <em>a man = adan</em>
				</li>

				<li>
					The definite article in Sindarin is <strong>i</strong>.<br>
					<span class="tab u">Example :</span> the man = i adan<br>
					It becomes <strong>ir</strong> in front of a word which starts with an "i".<br>
					<span class="tab u">Example :</span> <em>ir ithil = the moon</em><br>
					In front of a pluparl noun, it becomes <strong>in</strong>.<br>
					<span class="tab u">Example :</span> <em>the men = in edain</em>
				</li>

				<li>
					The genitive article in Sindarin is <strong>en</strong>. It is only used when the "owner" is a general substantive, it does not work with proper nouns nor known owners.<br>
					<span class="tab u">Example:</span> <em>cabed en aras = the deer's bounce // Aran Gondor = Gondor's king</em><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > This article can be found under the <strong>e</strong> form but it is exactly the same.<br>
					The plural genitive article is <strong>in</strong> and works the same way.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 class="u"> The "s" or "ss" problem </h1>
			
			<p>
				People who write and speak Sindarin are divied about the "s" or "ss" writing in monosyllabic words. The two forms can be found and it does not really matter because the oral difference is very small and subtle. Yet we will usually prefer the "ss" writing.
			</p>

			<h1 class="u"> The "in" problem </h1>
			
			<p>
				The translation of the word “in” to Sindarin is a complex problem which is very discussed. There are indeed four possible translations to this word which all have arguments for and against them. We will present you those four possibilities so you can choose.

			<br>

			<p> There are also two demonstrive pronouns in Sindarin : </p>
			<ul>
				<li> <strong>Sen</strong> which means "this/that" : it is singular </li>
