			<h1 class="u center"> How to use edhellenlam.fr ? </h1>
			<br>
			<h2 class="u"> I. Home </h2>
			<p>
				<span class="tab">On</span> this tab you will find a short presentation of the website. On the upper right hand corner is a flag-shaped button. It is either the french or the United-Kingdom’s flag, depending on which version of the website you are. Clicking on this button will change the website’s language. However this feature is only available for the home page.
			</p>

			<h2 class="u"> II. Translation tool </h2>
			<p>
				<span class="tab">This</span> is the tab of the translation tool itself. Its use is very easy : enter the word you would like to translate in the related field and press the Enter key or the “Translate !” button.
			</p>

			<img src="img/translation_fields.png" width="398" height="123" alt="Translations Fields" class="img_center">
			<p class="i legende"> Picture 1 : translation fields and “Translate !” button </p>

			<p>

				The indicated language matches the source language. On picture 1, the word we want to translate is “fire” which is an english word. We want to know its Sindarin equivalent.<br>
				The original word, the translated word and the Sindarin word’s nature (no matter if Sindarin is the source language or not) will then display.

			</p>

			<p class="tab u"> How to read the informations : </p>

			<p> 
				Here is an explanation about how to read the shown informations which display after the previous intervention.<br>
				The Sindarin word you can read is the “basic” word : it has no mutation, no agreement and is isolated from any sentence.
			</p>

			<p class="i legende"> Picture 2 : informations read </p>

			<h2 class="u"> III. More about Sindarin </h2>
			<p>
				<span class="tab">This</span> tab lists additional informations about Sindarin which we acquired during our lexical research. You will find for example pronunciation indications, some notes about how to use the determiners, and other useful informations.
			</p>

			<h2 class="u"> IV. Help and sources </h2>
			<p>
				<span class="tab">This tab</span> includes this very guide, and the sources from which come the informations given in this website. You will also find there an e-mail address to contact us if needed.
			</p>

			<h2 class="u"> V. Administration </h2>
			<p>
				<span class="tab">This</span> is the administration tab of the website, its access is restricted to the administrators and creators of the website thanks to a password (see picture 3). In case of a password mistake, the access is denied. Otherwise, the administration page shows.
			</p>

			<img class="img_center" src="img/password_field.png" width="276" height="41" alt="Password field">
			<p class="i legende"> Picture 3 : password field </p>

			<p>
				Once connected to the administration, it is possible to log off using the provided button (see picture 4) or clicking the Home tab. If the web page is inadvertently closed, the user is not logged off unless he comes back to the Home page instead of the administration page.
			</p>

			<img class="img_center" src="img/logout.png" width="66" height="35" alt="Logout button">
			<p class="i legende"> Picture 4 : logout button (in the bottom right-hand corner) </p>

			<p>
				The administration page allows to control the database which contains the English and Sindarin entries straight from the website.<br>
				New datas can be entered that way. You just need to enter the word in Sindarin, its translation(s) in English and its nature, then press the Entrer key or the “Insert !” button (see picture 5).
			</p>

			<img class="img_center" src="img/data_inserting.png" width="660" height="112" alt="Data inserting">
			<p class="i legende"> Picture 5 : data insertion area </p>

			<p>
				The entered informations are then added to the database. If one of the fields is empty or if the informations are already in the database, an error message shows to explain that there is an error, and why, and the datas are not sent. Careful ! All the three fields need to be identical to an index from the database to refuse to send the information.<br>
				<br>
				The administration page also allows to read the datas from the database, always straight from the website. You enter in the “Start” field the first entry to show and the last in the “End” field (see picture 6), then you press the Enter key or the “Read !” button. All the entries of the databases included between the start number and the end number will display.
